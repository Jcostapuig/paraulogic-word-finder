# paraulogic-word-finder
*A friend has shown me [this game](https://paraulogic.rodamots.cat/), it was fun but I preferred to automate it, here is the code.*

## Usage
1. Dictionary can be downloaded from http://montane.cat/disc/DISC2-LP.zip, an place `*.txt` file in the `paraulogic-word-finder` directory
    - tho, if you use [Rodamots](https://rodamots.cat/mots/arxiu-alfabetic/) dictionary will have better match.
2. Set today's letters in `paraulogic-word-finder.py`, at lines 3 & 4
3. Execute: `python paraulogic-word-finder.py`
4. Open browser console in https://paraulogic.rodamots.cat, and copy&paste the output of step 4 and press Enter
